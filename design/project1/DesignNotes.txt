IowaPen Web Site Design Notes


PURPOSE
IowaPen is an acronym for Iowa's Outstanding Writing And Pen Enthusiast's Network.  It's a pen club, a gathering of of people interesting in writing instruments, ink, paper, and related things.  The hobby is surprisingly broad, encompassing the myriad types of writing instruments, their history, construction, restoration and creation.  Besides history and handiwork, there are also arts (calligraphy and drawing and handwriting), chemistry (materials to construct pens, to create ink of various kinds, etc), and many other areas. 

I founded run this club, and we now have three chapters in various Iowa cities. We need a web site; we already have a lot of social media present but not everyone uses those. I had created a rudimentary site, hosted on a free web site hosting service that was so slow and touchy that we dropped it for a while.  I recently found GitHub pages and want to host at least a static version there.  Some future goals might require moving it elsewhere (like a service I use for my personal site, JavaPipe).

The site needs to have the following information:
     - Who and what we are
     - Where we meet
     - How to contact us
     - A calendar/list of upcoming events (both in our club and in the pen community)
     - Links to our social media sites
     
I also eventually want to add resources and information:
    - Good resources for pen hobbyists
    
    - Local resources for our chapter members
    
    - Pen stores, both local and worldwide (there's no good database, just many fragmentary ones) preferrably with a form to submit/edit new ones
    
    - Pen Shows (there are 17 per year all over the USA and many more worldwide - there needs to be a good single database of these too)
    
    - Pen Clubs - there are many all over the world, and again there's not good single point of contact.  There also some national and worldwide organizations such as the Pen Collectors of America
    
    - Publications (there are many books on the hobby, as well as several magazines)
    
As this course progresses and we study database use etc  I want to at least consider adding the following using that knowledge:

    - A blog to post about club and writing instrument news
    
    - A discussion forum to let members asks each other questions and discuss the many areas of the hobby.
    
And as we discuss databases, perhaps go from static lists of pen shows, pen clubs, pen stores, etc to database driven lists...sort of an IMDB for writing instruments (IWIDB?) and also add things like pen vendors, pen models, ink vendors, ink product lines and so on.  This could even be an ad-supported site as there are many pen stores that advertise online, Amazon ads, etc.

The site's template is modelled after the UCD Resume we did in class but I have moved the button navigation menu to the left side instead of the bottom of the footer.  I want to make the buttons look like ink sample swatches and at least initially I have use gradients (both linear and radial, for variety and effect) to simular the color gradients/shading that fountain pen ink sample swatches have.
