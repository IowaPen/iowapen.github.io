TO DO

[x] Make version of logo with black outline and filled with gold

[i] Make nav button column to content column ration 1/4 to 3/4 instad of 1/3 to 2/3 as move to larger screens, e.g. col-xl-4 & col-xl-8 so that we get smaller menu area

[x] Create a template page for the basic structure before adding content
    [x] Header with logo and title and full name
    [x] Navigation button in center section, left two-thirds, or possibly one . third in larger sizes, or full width buttons in the smaller sizes

[x] Create a home page with "About" information and the upcoming meetings

[x] Create an events page with information about meeting further out, and eventually pen-related events such as Fountain Pen Day, Pelikan Hub, Pen Show dates, and much more (there are a surprising number of National Days and World Days related to writing instruments, writing, etc. 

[x] Create a chapters page listing the chapters available.  We've gone from one to three in about the same number of years, consider the Omaha-based Midlands Pen Club our "Western" chapter, and are trying to get chapters started in other cities such as near the Sheaffer Pen Museum in Southeast Iowa where there's a large cluster of members who are too far away (2-3 hour drives) to make our current chapter meetings in centeral and eastern Iowa.

[i] Try site on iPhone 1 and iPhone 3gs, original iPad.

[ ] Upgrade Parallels VM to latest (I subscribe to annual updates) and test with IE 10,11, Firefox, Chrome on Windows, also on Linux.

[i] Switch from 1/3-2/3 column ration in <section> to 1/4-3/4 column ration in xl screen size, maybe lg size.

[ ] Investigate oing from a 1/3rd-2/3rds layout to a 1/4-3/4 layout on the larger size breakpoints (-xl and maybe -lg) or maybe to 3 columns or more of buttons so the buttons don't get HUGE on either widescreen monitors or on small smartphone screens

  [ ] Make even the -xs size screen layout via Bootstrap go to two columns of buttons so users won't have to scroll so much

OTHER TASKS

[i] Contact IowaPen East leader Danielle Chargo for permission to use the logo she designed and get a clear version if avaialble (Photoshop?) before we go live on www.iowapen.club /.com
[x] Make transparent version of logo
    [x] Turn outline of logo from black to gold
    [x] Decide on background color (brown? dark green? Dark red?)
[x] Use gradients to make logo and larger display text appear to have shading like fountain pen inks often do.
[ ] Can I apply gradients on a character by character basis? Use <span> for each letter of the title and maybe subtitle? Time consuming work, but might be very cool and appropriate.
    [ answer: yes - see code and link is style.css, a very good target that is styled differently from regular text anyway]
[ ] Use the pen quote database and read one randomly each time the page is refreshed, display in the header or footer.
[ ] Also have a page to let people customize and format the pen quotes (see my Quooqle site) - look at meme creation sites for examples?
[ ] Members page - with photo and handwritten (by member) information about them
[ ] Login system
   [ ] Let admins edit blog, events, other things on page not just AirTable
