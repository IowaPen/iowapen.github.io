MILESTONE PROJECT 2 (and beyond) TASKS

[x] Finish club email contact page by linking to EmailJS

[x] Create club members maps using data from question on FB etc; have an Iowa Map (and part of surrounding states), USA map, and World map

[ ] Move club member map data into AirTable database table and read it from there, so we can add easily w/o code changes.

[x] Switch Vue to production mode from development mode https://vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html

[x] Share the database READ-ONLY with an 'IowaPenReadOnly" AirTable account amd use the app_id and app_key from IowaPenReadOnly to make sure this can't be modified (for now)

[x] Make the data into a table and use the same Bootstrap table styling we use for other tables on the IowaPen site

[ ] Having the data in a more readable checklist form WITH A CHECKBOX VISIBLE might be nice too.  Let them print a 
    checklist of books for their use. 
    [ ] Make it look nice when printed using media queries; stripping header/footer etc of web page not needed on paper.

[ ] Put links to AirTable and a way for them to copy the table to their AirTable account for their own use?

[x] Create a database for club and pen events and display THAT from a table too.

[ ] Add an Email form to submit a data for the various page. Use EmailJS to mail (create a generic form and concat 
the various fields into the body, one per line so we don't have to have a billion EmailJS forms...since their free
plan only allows two forms!
